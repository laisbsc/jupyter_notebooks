# jupyter_notebooks
A collection of useful notebooks put together by me. The aim is to have a source of truth for _all_ Jupyter Notebooks I create which could be used
for future reference.

All folders will have the iPython files `ipynb` and a `requirements.txt` with the dependencies for the project.

Hoe to install the enviroments:
* Using `pip`: ` pip install -r requirements.txt` on the root folder using the CLI.
* Using `conda`: `conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt`
Both require the virtual environment to be activated after all (according to the OS). If using `conda`: `conda activate <env_name>`.

This repository is aimed for personal use, in any case if you find something useful, feel free to download and play with it.
